# Edge field definitions to enable nodes and edges in ArangoDB
"""
    This class implements the "Edge" Field definition for Django model classes.
    The Edge field definition is used to create vertex and edge models in a
    graph database backend for Django.  This is implemented for ArangoDB only.
    The model does not currently support other graph DB backends.

    There is no explicit field to support ArangoDB 'vertex' objects in Djarango.
    Instead, every Django model in Djarango is implicitly an ArangoDB vertex.
    In ArangoDB, everything is stored as a document at the lowest level.  Other
    ArangoDB storage paradigms are built on top of documents.  The Djarango
    integration stores all models as documents in ADB, so by default they are
    also candidates to be
    vertices.  When an edge field is added to any model, the model is then
    treated as a vertex.  In the ArangoDB backend, the collection for that
    model becomes a vertex collection, and an edge collection is created for the
    edge field that has been added to the model.  A graph is also created for
    the model and edge collections, and they are also added to the graph.  By
    convention, Djarango generates a name for the graph based on the model that
    contains the
    edge fields.  This may be overridden by setting 'graph_name' in the edge
    field definition.  Multiple edge definitions may be added to the same graph.

    Djarango only allows 'outbound' edge fields.  An inbound edge is created
    by default on the model specified as the other end of the edge.  Bidirectional
    edges may be created by adding edge fields to both models and specifying
    the same edge name.

    Edge definitions are identified by name, and each edge definition name
    within a model must be unique.

    There is no direct example in Django documentation to create this type
    of Field definition.  It is probably closest to the ManyToManyField, but
    does not require actual creation of a 'through' table.  I have pasted
    some basic examples below.

    From Django documentation:
        - need to be able to do things like this with the EdgeField:
            #
            example = MyModel.objects.get(pk=1)
            print(example.hand.north) # bridge hand example
            # ...
            new_model = MyModel()
            new_model.hand = some_hand
            new_model.save() # saves all model fields, including 'hand'

        -- key point -- Django fields are stored as normal Python objects in the
            attribute members of the model class.  The field class definitions are
            actually stored in the Meta class when the model class is created.

        -- two classes typically created for a model field:
            Class 1: Python object that users manipulate; assign it to the model
            attribute and read from it for display purposes (e.g., Edge() class); in
            this case, the Edge class is likely just a string that stores the name of
            the edge collection.  Or should it be a dict that stores the name of
            the edge collection, vertex collection, and graph?.
            > actually, this may need to be the _key attribute for the relevant
              edge collection

            Class 2: Field subclass; this class knows how to convert the first class
            back and forth between its permanent storage and the Python form.  E.g.,
            EdgeField() class.
            > This class provides the machinery for converting between Python
              instances and backend DB storage.

        -- writing the Field subclass (my main job):
            > need to create __init__() and deconstruct() methods for the
              subclass:
              __init__()    - separate subclass-specific parameters and pass the
                              rest to super

              deconstruct() - used by model migrations to tell Django how to
                              take an instance of the (edge) field and reduce it
                              to a serialized form --- specify args to pass to
                              __init__() to recreate the field (seems like the
                              opposite of deconstruct...)

        -- the base Field class __init__() method takes the following parameters:
            verbose_name
            name
            primary_key
            max_length
            unique
            blank
            null
            db_index
            rel: Used for related fields (like ForeignKey). For advanced use only.
            default
            editable
            serialize: If False, the field will not be serialized when the model
                is passed to Django’s serializers. Defaults to True.
            unique_for_date
            unique_for_month
            unique_for_year
            choices
            help_text
            db_column
            db_tablespace: Only for index creation, if the backend supports
                tablespaces. You can usually ignore this option.
            auto_created: True if the field was automatically created, as for
                the OneToOneField used by model inheritance. For advanced use only.

            Ones I care about:
                name    : need to create the edge collection based on this name.
                rel     : not sure if I care about this or not - guess it may
                          be the model on the other end of the edge ?
                auto_created : might need to use this for edge collection model

        -- document the new field:
            1) provide a docstring
            2) add desc to django.contrib.admindocs

        -- db_type() and rel_db_type()
            "CREATE TABLE"
                These are called when Django constructs "CREATE TABLE" statements.
                Typically they would need to know the type for the column(s) to be created.
                This is not likely to matter with ArangoDB (NoSQL) for the edge field case.
            "WHERE"
                These are also called during "WHERE" clause processing to retrieve
                records from the DB for models that include these fields.  This
                is likely to be needed for the edge field case.
            rel_db_type() used by ForeignKey and OneToOneField  to determine their
                column db types.
            db_type/rel_db_type can return None, which allows the field model to do more
                complex SQL generation.

        -- from_db_value() and to_python()
            If edge Field has data structures more complex than strings, integers, etc.,
            then may need to override these methods.

            from_db_value() called in all cases when data is loaded from the DB,
                including within aggregates (?) and values() calls.

            to_python() called by deserialization and during clean() method with forms
                This method must be able to handle the following arguments properly:
                1) The correct type (e.g., Edge class)
                2) A string
                3) None

                Note the example later in this file, copied from Django.

    In the general case, each model field maps to a DB column type.  The edge field case is
    a bit different, in that the field does not directly map to a single column.
    Instead, the edge field definition triggers the creation of an edge collection
    (effectively a new table), that includes the Model collection as either a
    source or target vertex collection (or both).  The edge collection is created
    with from_ and to_ attributes, as are all ArangoDB edge collections.

    Djarango does not support explicit creation of 'graph' models; they are only
    created implicitly via the edge field definition.  Djarango does provide
    utilities for querying and displaying all graphs that have been generated by
    the addition of edge fields to various models.

    Each edge field added to a model class definition must specify the model
    (vertex collection) on the other end of the edge.

    Djarango only allows outbound edges.  Inbound edges by definition are the
    other end of an outbound edge definition.  This avoids the possibility of
    mis-matched inbound/outbound/both edge definitions.

    Djarango uses a 'through' model as the edge model.  The attributes stored in the
    model may have any of the existing Django field attributes, but may not include
    other edge attributes (maybe in a future version?)


    >>> What I think the EdgeField() needs to do:
    - migration
      > A model with edge fields should result in the generation of all the
        relevant collections (tables) when migration runs.  Includes:
        . Edge collection definition
        . Source vertex collection
        . Target vertex collection
      > The edge collection should have source and target vertex collections
        specified as src/dst models
        . Example:
            {            '_key': 'g_general_javamatan',
                          '_id': '_graphs/g_general_javamatan',
                         '_rev': '_dBzWpT----',
              'edgeDefinitions': [ { 'collection': 'ged_general_javamatan',
                                           'from': ['gv_general_javamatan'],
                                             'to': ['gv_general_javamatan']}
                                 ],
            'orphanCollections': ['gvtx_general_javamatan']
            }
        . Summary of contents:
            1)  name of the graph
            2)  list of edge definitions
            3)  orphan collections
        . Summary of what should be generated by migration
            1)  An edge definition based on the model with the edge field and
                the model specified as the 'edge_model' or 'through' table
                1) collection name for the edge collection
                2) list of 'from' vertex collections; if this is the first time
                   the edge definition has been used, it will create the first
                   vertex collection in the list
                3) list of 'to' vertex collections; same as point (2) above

            2)  A graph definition containing the edge definition.  If a name is
                given for the graph, then use that name, and add the ED to the graph
                if it already exists.  If no graph name is given, generate a default
                graph name.

            ED parameters
            1)  Other end model name - mandator - must correspond to a real model
                (lazy binding allowed)
            2)  An edge definition name - optional - this is the 'through'
                model name.  If no name is given, generate a default name.
            3)  A graph name - optional


      > the name of the edge collection should be automatically, unless specified
        by the user, via 'through' keyword.  If the 'through' keyword is used, then
        Djarango should use the model specified as the edge collection model.
        Initially, I think it is not a good idea to allow edges on models within
        edge collections, even though I think ArangoDB supports it.  Djarango
        should detect this case during migration and either generate an error or
        warning.
      > in ArangoDB, there is an edge collection for each direction.  In Djarango
        there should be an edge model for each direction, but it should be allowed
        to use the same model as the reverse direction, but it must refer to
        separate, distinct edge collections in ArangoDB.
      > self-referential edges should not be allowed

    - writing
      > when actual models (vertices) are connected it should create new records
        in the edge collection
      > when a specific instance of a dst model is added to a specific instance
        of the src model and save()'d, the edge collection should be updated
        with a new record (with each instance of the relevant models on each end
        of the record).
    - reading
      > when the edge field is referenced, it should read the far end of the edge.
      > there should be accessors for the edge model and the far end model.

    - querying
      > The primary value of adding graph models as a backend DB is to support
        graph DB algorithms for queries and processing (e.g., ML to identify
        networks and patterns).

    NOTES ON MAKEMIGRATIONS
    - autodetector.py does primary work of detecting new/deleted models and model changes
    - models with a FK relationship have a 'remote_field' attribute that holds info
      about the FK target.
